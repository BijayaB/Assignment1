<h1 style="color: #276678; font-size:90px;" >Hello,</h1>
</sub>

<p style="color: #1687a7;" >My name is <strong>BIJAYA</strong> Biju Jayakumari. I was born in Kerala, India, and moved to Malaysia for five years in regards to my dad’s job. We moved to Melbourne in 2008. This year, I am studying for a Bachelor of Information Technology. I am currently in my first year. I chose to study Information Technology at RMIT because RMIT offers flexible learning options and opportunities where students can gain experience through hands-on learning and internships as part of their course. These opportunities will help me further explore the various career opportunities that are available and secure a well-paid job within the IT industry. During my leisure time, I like to watch TV shows, especially kdramas, and also listen to kpop music as these activities lift my mood. I am very passionate about music. I was born into a very musical family. My dad plays multiple instruments, my mum sings and my sister and I play the piano. I have been playing the piano for over seven years now. I also love listening to music while doing daily activities like chores around the house, walking, or even studying. I feel that listening to music allows me to relax and focus. I also like playing the piano during my spare time, especially when I am overwhelmed by my surroundings.<p>

<h2 style="color: #276678; text-align: center">INTEREST IN INFOTECH</h2>
</psub>

<p style="color: #1687a7;">I find IT interesting because it is always evolving. There are always new and improved devices and software updates. People are dependent on technology now more than ever especially due to the pandemic. Technology allows users to connect with friends and family around the world despite not being able to gather with them physically due to traveling-restrictions. It also keeps people entertained during the lengthy lockdowns through streaming applications such Netflix, YouTube, Stan, etc. My interest in IT began during high school as I realized that IT is the future and therefore there will be many careers within the IT industry. I chose to come to RMIT because RMIT has a huge focus on computer sciences and also provides opportunities to do internships which allows me to get work experience within the IT industry. During my studies at RMIT, I expect to learn everything I would need to know to get a well-paid job and do that job well.

<h2 style="color: #276678; text-align: center">IDEAL JOB</h2>
</psub>

<p style="color: #1687a7">My ideal job currently is to be an IT support officer. As an IT support officer, I will be responsible for managing the computer and networking systems of the organization I work for. This position is particularly appealing because I will be given opportunities to travel to various locations and also work from home. Traveling through the company means it is likely the company would pay for my ticket. As an IT support officer, I will be required to solve technical and application problems such as installing and configuring computer hardware and software systems. I will also be required to communicate with clients both face to face and over the phone to assist those who are experiencing technical problems. I currently have no qualifications to do this job but hopefully, after graduating from RMIT, I will be capable to do all that is required of me as an IT support officer. To gain qualifications and experience, I will try to attend as many workshops and internships as possible so that I can further explore what my position will require of me. My ideal working hours will be six to seven hours a day with a salary of about $60 per hour. I want to be able to travel to various countries and engage with different people and experience other IT systems without having to pay for the expenses. I would like some interaction with my customers so I can understand how useful my product is for them and what needs to be improved to better the performance. During my career, I want to be able to explore the various jobs in IT and be given many opportunities where I can improve myself.

<p style="color: #1687a7"> From the results, it can be concluded that I am an introvert which is quite accurate. I believe I have a reserved personality as I don't like starting conversations with new people. I prefer to work in quiet environments and don't like working in a group. I am very observant and reflective but also an over-thinker. These results may influence my future behavior in a team as I will try to be more involved in group discussions within my team and contribute as much as possible. When forming a team, I should try to take initiative and talk to my peers to find people with whom I can connect with.</p>

<h2 style="color: #276678; text-align: center">PROJECT IDEA: TECH-SUPPORT APPLICATION</h2>
</psub>

<h3 style="color: #276678">OVERVIEW</h3>
<p style="color: #1687a7">The TechSupport is an application that can guide users who need assistance in fixing minor technical problems within their devices or popular software applications. This application gives an easy step to step guide for users who are not computer literate or just need a hand to fix small problems that they may encounter which doesn’t necessarily need IT Support to fix. This application is important because many people struggle with small technical issues with easy solutions. A handy application can help them to fix the problem and further enhance their IT skills. This application is targeted at an older generation who are less experienced with technology. Yet, through this application, they can improve their IT skills as well as fix their technical difficulties themselves.  
</p>

<h3 style="color: #276678">MOTIVATION</h3> 
<p style="color: #1687a7">The TechSupport application is interesting because the world of technology is evolving but it is no secret that some of us are falling behind. Many individuals struggle with using everyday technology. So building a TechSupport Application to help users who encounter difficulties while using their devices can gain assistance from this application. Similar applications that currently exist are ‘Zendesk’ with 500K downloads and ‘Freshdesk’ with 100K downloads. These applications allow IT technicians to assist their clients with any technical difficulties they are having. According to the users of these applications, both applications have unnecessary notifications but the application allows clients to speak to businesses regarding their inquiries. This application will be especially helpful during the pandemic as people are restricted from traveling. People can receive help faster and IT Support technicians will be able to attend to more people. 
</p>

<h3 style="color: #276678">DESCRIPTION</h3>
<p style="color: #1687a7">The TechSupport application will provide users with tips to try when faced with certain problems before calling IT Support for help. Users will be encouraged to create an account so that the application can be personalized for their own needs. When creating an account, users will be asked to describe their skills in using technology as ‘Novice, Intermediate, Advanced and Expert’ as users are expected to have different levels of expertise and knowledge. Users can also customize their notifications to what they prefer and feel is necessary. This means the application can save all past searches and changes made in their settings which they can retrieve when logging on to any device. Users will be able to search up the problem that they are facing just as they would on any search engine and the app will provide simple steps to fix their problems and also links from other websites where users can get more information. The steps will be easy to read for users as using sophisticated or technical language may confuse them. Users may also search by voice rather than typing their query. A translator will be provided within the app for users who prefer to view the application in a language of their own choice. A video will also be provided showing how to fix the problem for users who prefer visual instructions. The application will be easy to use with a simple navigation system for its users to make it more user-friendly. There will be an accessibility setting within the app for users who prefer contrast, dark mode, and enlarged or reduced font. This application not only caters to the needs of technical support within devices but also provides support for software issues users may face on other applications such as social media applications that are supported by the application. Users can suggest and comment inquiries that they may have on how to improve the application which will be taken to consideration. The application will interact with the users as a personal IT assistant so that users can encounter all their technical problems without hesitation. If the user is unable to handle the situation by themselves through the search engine provided within the application, they can live chat with an IT Support technician who can walk them through the process to sort out their problems. If the user is still having trouble, the users will have the option to call up an IT Support technician who can assist the user over the phone or through a video chat depending on what is more convenient and makes the user more comfortable. 
</p>

<h3 style="color: #276678">TOOLS & SKILLS</h3>
<p style="color: #1687a7">To build this application, I need a cross-platform mobile application developer like Xamarin to reach a wider audience and a computing device suitable for building the application. This project will help me gain the knowledge and experience required to make me qualified for my ideal job, as I will gain a basic understanding of what kind of technical problems people face and what solutions can fix these problems. It would be interesting to see what kind of problems people encounter the most while using their devices or software applications. I will need to research what kind of problems people encounter most frequently by the majority of the users. I must test solutions before providing them to the users for their use. I need to ensure that the steps provided are easy to read for users. 
</p>

<h3 style="color: #276678">OUTCOME</h3>
<p style="color: #1687a7">If this application will become successful, IT technicians can focus on assisting larger problems while users can learn how to fix the problems they encounter and gain more IT skills. This will make users more confident with using their devices as they can rely on their IT Support assistant if they ever encounter any issues.
